# Data Structures Practice

This is a repo I have created to upload my practice files dedicated to abstract data structures
in Java. Much of the code probably needs plenty of refactoring, but my primary goal is to implement
working data structures for learning purposes. Every data structure has minimal functionality that
I'll probably expand later on - the goal for now is to diversify my data structure knowledge.
